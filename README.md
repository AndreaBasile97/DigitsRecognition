Digits Recognition
==============================

This project aims to develop an AI-enabled system that focus on Digits recognition from images using a Convolutional Neural Network

Project Organization
------------
For this project we will be using a CNN that is a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images. A CNN is a powerful tool but requires millions of labelled data points for training. CNNs must be trained with high-power processors, such as a GPU or an NPU, if they are to produce results quickly enough to be useful.
