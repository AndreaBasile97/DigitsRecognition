## Evaluation Data

- **Datasets:** MNIST database
- **Motivation:** The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
- **Preprocessing:**

```pyton 
# scale pixels
def prep_pixels(train, test):
    # convert from integers to floats
    train_norm = train.astype("float32")
    test_norm = test.astype("float32")
    # normalize to range 0-1
    train_norm = train_norm / 255.0
    test_norm = test_norm / 255.0
    # return normalized images
    return train_norm, test_norm
```
