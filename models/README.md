## Factors

- **Relevant Factors:** [List of Relevant Factors]
- **Evaluation Factors:** network depth, network width and cardinality

## Metrics

- **Model Performance Measures:** Accuracy
- **Decision Thresholds:** 90%
- **Variation Approaches:** [List of Variation Approaches]

## Evaluation Data

- **Datasets:** MNIST database
- **Motivation:** The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)
- **Preprocessing:**

```pyton 
# scale pixels
def prep_pixels(train, test):
    # convert from integers to floats
    train_norm = train.astype("float32")
    test_norm = test.astype("float32")
    # normalize to range 0-1
    train_norm = train_norm / 255.0
    test_norm = test_norm / 255.0
    # return normalized images
    return train_norm, test_norm
```  
  

## Training Data

- **Distribution Over Factors in Training Datasets:** The dataset is composed of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples

## Quantitative Analyses

- **Unitary Results:** [Results of Unitary Analyses]
- **Intersectional Results:** [Results of Intersectional Analyses]

## Ethical Considerations

This project aims to recognize grades on students tests. Wrong predictions can led to wrong grades reporting and potentially harm the students.

## Caveats and Recommendations

The model can fail when digits are not clearly written. In order to get a good predictions we recommend to write numbers in a clear
