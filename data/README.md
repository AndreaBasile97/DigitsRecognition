train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: training set labels (28881 bytes)
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: test set images (1648877 bytes)
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: test set labels (4542 bytes)## Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- **Digit Recognition Task**: The dataset is commonly used for training models to recognize handwritten digits. Success is measured by achieving high accuracy, with models like the [LeNet](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) architecture setting a benchmark.

## Languages

The dataset primarily focuses on numerical characters and doesn't involve natural language processing. As such, language-related considerations are not applicable.

# Dataset Structure

## Data Instances

**Example:**
```json
{
  'image': 'link_to_image_file',
  'label': 7
}
```
The dataset comprises images of handwritten digits (0-9), with corresponding labels indicating the digit's identity.

## Data Fields

- **image**: The pixel values of the handwritten digit image.
- **label**: The digit represented by the image (0-9).

## Data Splits

The dataset typically includes training and testing splits. The training set is used for model training, while the testing set evaluates the model's performance.

# Dataset Creation

## Curation Rationale

The MNIST dataset was created to provide a standardized benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. Its curation aimed to offer a diverse range of handwritten digit samples for robust model training and evaluation.

## Source Data

**Initial Data Collection and Normalization**

The dataset was collected from a set of 250 individuals, each contributing unique handwritten digit samples. The data normalization process involved centering and resizing images to achieve consistency.

## Annotations

The dataset contains annotations in the form of digit labels corresponding to each handwritten sample. Annotations were created during the initial data collection process.

**Annotation Process**

Annotations were generated by individuals during the collection phase, associating each image with the correct digit label.

**Who are the annotators?**

Annotators were human contributors involved in the dataset creation, ensuring accurate labeling of handwritten digit samples.

## Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset does not involve personal or sensitive information, as it focuses solely on handwritten digits.

# Considerations for Using the Data

## Social Impact of Dataset

The use of the MNIST dataset contributes positively to the advancement of computer vision and machine learning, particularly in the domain of handwritten digit recognition. The technologies developed using this dataset can enhance various applications, such as automated postal code reading and digit-based information extraction.

## Discussion of Biases

As the dataset revolves around handwritten digits, biases related to language, identity, or demographics are not applicable. However, biases in digit representation, writing styles, or cultural variations may affect model performance.

## Other Known Limitations

While MNIST is widely used, it has limitations such as its simplicity compared to real-world scenarios. The dataset's uniform and grayscale nature may not fully capture the challenges present in diverse handwriting styles and backgrounds.
